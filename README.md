📊 Matplotlib Data Visualization Project

This repository contains data visualization projects using Matplotlib, a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

📚 Overview
Matplotlib is a popular plotting library for Python, enabling the creation of a wide range of static, interactive, and animated visualizations. This repository demonstrates how to use Matplotlib for tasks such as data plotting, customizations, and creating various types of charts.

✨ Features
📈 Creating different types of plots (line, bar, histogram, scatter, etc.)
🎨 Customizing plot elements (colors, styles, labels, etc.)
🗺️ Creating subplots for multi-plot visualization
🔄 Animating plots for dynamic data
🌍 Plotting geographical data
🧑‍💻 Interactivity with widgets and toolkits
🚀 Installation
To run this project locally, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matplotlib-data-visualization.git
cd matplotlib-data-visualization
pip install -r requirements.txt
💻 Usage
Here’s an example of using Matplotlib to create a simple line plot:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data to plot
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

# Create a plot
plt.plot(x, y)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('X Axis')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis')
plt.title('Simple Line Plot')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
